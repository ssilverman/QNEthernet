This document details the changes between each release.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.0-snapshot]

### Added
* The Boolean-valued link state is now `EthernetClass::linkState()`.

### Changed
* `EthernetClass::linkStatus()` now returns an `EthernetLinkStatus` enum. The
  Boolean version is now `EthernetClass::linkState()`.
* The `EthernetLinkStatus` enum is no longer marked as deprecated.

## [0.6.0]

### Added
* Added a new "survey of how connections work" section to the README.
* Added low-level link receive error stats collection.
* Now calling `EthernetClass::loop()` in `EthernetUDP::parsePacket()` when it
  returns zero so that calls in a loop will move the stack forward.
* Added `EthernetLinkStatus` enum (marked as deprecated) for compatibility with
  the Arduino API. Note that `EthernetClass::linkStatus()` is staying as a
  `bool`; comparison with the enumerators will work correctly.
* Now sending a DHCPINFORM message to the network when using a manual
  IP configuration.

### Changed
* Changed `EthernetClass::loop()` to be `static`.
* Changed all the internal "`yield()` to move the stack along" calls to
  `EthernetClass::loop()`. Note that the calls within `while` loops in the
  external API functions were not changed.

### Fixed
* Fixed the driver to add and remove netif ext callback at the correct places.
  This solves the freeze problem when ending Ethernet, however when restarting,
  DHCP isn't able to get an IP address.

## [0.5.0]

### Added
* Added a "Code style" section to the README.
* Added link-status and address-changed callbacks.
* New `EthernetServer::end()` function to stop listening.
* Disabling the PLL before disabling the clock in `enet_deinit()`. This still
  doesn't solve the freeze problem when this function is called.
* New `EthernetClass::linkSpeed()` function, used as `Ethernet.linkSpeed()`.
  It returns the link speed in Mbps.

### Changed
* Changed all the delays to yields because `delay()` just loops and calls
  `yield()` anyway.
* No longer looping when checking the TCP send buffer in the client write
  functions. Instead, just using an `if`.
* The client now takes more opportunities to set the internal connection pointer
  to NULL, meaning the caller doesn't necessarily need to guarantee they call
  `stop()` if other I/O functions are being used to check state or to write,
  for example.
* Moved adding the netif callback to `enet_init()` so that the callback still
  gets an address-changed notification when setting a static address.

### Fixed
* Fixed client functions to also check for connected status.
* Fixed client `read()` and `peek()` to return -1 on no connection.
* Added potential flushing in `EthernetClient::availableForWrite()`. This keeps
  things moving along if it always would return zero.
* A listening server is now correctly added to the internal listening list. This
  fixes `EthernetServer::operator bool()`.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
* This CHANGELOG.
* Instructions in the README for how to use with Arduino.
* Added the ability to add TXT items to mDNS services.
* New `Ethernet::waitForLocalIP(timeout)` function that waits for a
  DHCP-assigned address.
* Added the ability to re-announce mDNS services. This is useful to prevent the
  entries from disappearing.
* Added mDNS notes to the README.

### Changed
* Updated lwIP to v2.1.3-rc1.
* Moved global objects (`Ethernet` and `MDNS`) into the `qindesign::network`
  namespace.

### Fixed
* UDP multicast address check was checking the wrong byte.
* UDP multicast now IGMP joins the group.

## [0.3.0]

### Changed
* Updated lwIP to the "real" v2.1.2 release.
* The library now works with Arduino.

### Fixed
* `EthernetUDP::endPacket()` was using `nullptr` for the pbuf.
* `EthernetUDP::beginPacket()` was not setting the output port.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
* Small delays in `EthernetClient` output functions to allow data to flush. This
  allows user programs to avoid having to call `yield()` themselves.
* Flushing the output before closing the connection in `EthernetClient::stop()`.
* Global Arduino-style `MDNS` object and a rename of the class to `MDNSClass`.
* `yield()` calls in the `EthernetClient` input functions to allow user programs
  to avoid having to call `yield()` themselves.

### Changed
* Brought `Print::write` functions into scope for Client, Server, and UDP by
  using a `using Print::write` directive.
* New centralized connection management.

### Removed
* Removed all the atomic fences.

### Fixed
* Fixed `EthernetClass::begin()` return value; it was the opposite.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
* Initial release.
