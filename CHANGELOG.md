This document details the changes between each release.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0-snapshot]

### Added
* Added a new "survey of how connections work" section to the README.
* Added low-level link receive error stats collection.
* Now calling `yield()` in `EthernetUDP::parsePacket()` when it returns zero so
  that calls in a loop will move the stack forward.

### Changed
* Changed `EthernetClass::loop()` to be `static`.
* Changed all the internal "`yield()` to move the stack along" calls to
  `EthernetClass::loop()`. Note that the calls within `while` loops in the
  external API functions were not changed.

## [0.5.0]

### Added
* Added a "Code style" section to the README.
* Added link-status and address-changed callbacks.
* New `EthernetServer::end()` function to stop listening.
* Disabling the PLL before disabling the clock in `enet_deinit()`. This still
  doesn't solve the freeze problem when this function is called.
* New `EthernetClass::linkSpeed()` function, used as `Ethernet.linkSpeed()`.
  It returns the link speed in Mbps.

### Changed
* Changed all the delays to yields because `delay()` just loops and calls
  `yield()` anyway.
* No longer looping when checking the TCP send buffer in the client write
  functions. Instead, just using an `if`.
* The client now takes more opportunities to set the internal connection pointer
  to NULL, meaning the caller doesn't necessarily need to guarantee they call
  `stop()` if other I/O functions are being used to check state or to write,
  for example.
* Moved adding the netif callback to `enet_init()` so that the callback still
  gets an address-changed notification when setting a static address.

### Fixed
* Fixed client functions to also check for connected status.
* Fixed client `read()` and `peek()` to return -1 on no connection.
* Added potential flushing in `EthernetClient::availableForWrite()`. This keeps
  things moving along if it always would return zero.
* A listening server is now correctly added to the internal listening list. This
  fixes `EthernetServer::operator bool()`.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
* This CHANGELOG.
* Instructions in the README for how to use with Arduino.
* Added the ability to add TXT items to mDNS services.
* New `Ethernet::waitForLocalIP(timeout)` function that waits for a
  DHCP-assigned address.
* Added the ability to re-announce mDNS services. This is useful to prevent the
  entries from disappearing.
* Added mDNS notes to the README.

### Changed
* Updated lwIP to v2.1.3-rc1.
* Moved global objects (`Ethernet` and `MDNS`) into the `qindesign::network`
  namespace.

### Fixed
* UDP multicast address check was checking the wrong byte.
* UDP multicast now IGMP joins the group.

## [0.3.0]

### Changed
* Updated lwIP to the "real" v2.1.2 release.
* The library now works with Arduino.

### Fixed
* `EthernetUDP::endPacket()` was using `nullptr` for the pbuf.
* `EthernetUDP::beginPacket()` was not setting the output port.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
* Small delays in `EthernetClient` output functions to allow data to flush. This
  allows user programs to avoid having to call `yield()` themselves.
* Flushing the output before closing the connection in `EthernetClient::stop()`.
* Global Arduino-style `MDNS` object and a rename of the class to `MDNSClass`.
* `yield()` calls in the `EthernetClient` input functions to allow user programs
  to avoid having to call `yield()` themselves.

### Changed
* Brought `Print::write` functions into scope for Client, Server, and UDP by
  using a `using Print::write` directive.
* New centralized connection management.

### Removed
* Removed all the atomic fences.

### Fixed
* Fixed `EthernetClass::begin()` return value; it was the opposite.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
* Initial release.
